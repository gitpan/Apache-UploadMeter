Apache/UploadMeter
================================

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

   Apache::Request
   Cache::Cache
   Apache::SSI

IMPORTANT NOTICE:
    This package currently requires a DEVELOPMENT version of libapreq
    (a.k.a. Apache::Request).  A patch is included here which can be
    used against libapreq-0.33  The file is Apache_Request.patch
    
    Future versions of libapreq will not require this.

FUTURE INCLUSIONS:
    This package supports *one* UploadMeter for the entire server (eg,
    mod_perl_start.pl) that it's in.  This must be changed.  It will. 
    Don't worry about it.  DO bug me (nicely) about it, if you need it.
    Also, suggestions on how the configuration for multiple
    UploadMeters could be implemented would be nice.  I sorta don't
    really have any sense of how to set up the external configuration...
