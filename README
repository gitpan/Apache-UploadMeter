DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

   mod_perl2
   Apache2::Request
   Cache::Cache

COMPATIBILITY

Beginning from version 0.99_01, this module is only compatible with
Apache2/mod_perl2 Support for Apache 1.3.x is discontinued, as it's too damn
complicated to configure in Apache 1.3.x  This may change in the future, but I
doubt it; servers are slowly but surely migrating from 1.3 to 2.x  Maybe it's
finally time for you to upgrade too.
